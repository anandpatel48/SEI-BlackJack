# Project Description
The game is BlackJack. The player will play against a dealer. When the game starts, there will be a shuffling of the deck and the dealers cards will appear 1 face up and 1 face down. The player will have both of their cards face up. There will be a wager of 100 per hand and the player will start out with 1000. When the game starts there will be a wager and balance section that will show a wager of 100 and a balance of 900. The player can elect to hit or stay as long as their total is below 21. If they hit and the total goes above 21, they lose, and if they hit and reach 21 or reach 21 with their beginning hand, they win 100. The shown cards will be removed from the deck. At a certain point in the deck, the cards will automatically reshuffle and the game will continue.

This will be the screen the player sees when they start the game. Once start game is clicked, the game will start and they will then be able to begin playing. The wager board will show a 100 wager and 900 balance immediately and the dealer hand and player hand will be shown. What it looks like will be shown below.

The player will be able to hit if their total is below 21, or stay if they like where they are. The dealer will have programs to hit, and whoever is closest to 21 without going over will win the hand. The reset button allows the player to reset the game with the hands shuffled and the wager board reset as well.
