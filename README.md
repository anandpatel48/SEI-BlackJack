# SEI-BlackJack

This game will compose of two players. Player one on the left and player two on the right. There will be a deck of 52 cards (still unsure of whether or not there will be more than 1 deck). Before each round, out of the deck of 52 (maybe 312 cards-6 decks) there will be a pre determined stopping point for that round. 

Players will be given two cards face up, and they will be able to decide whether to hit or stay. Whichever player gets closest to 21 without exceeding 21 will be the winner and that will be tallied in a score box. 

Players can start or reset the game by hitting the reset button somewhere on the screen. 

As a potential stretch feature, a dealer will be involved that will play against 1 player specifically. The dealer will have to have some form of AI that will play against the player. The players cards will be shown face up, where as the dealers card will be face down.

I propose a block design where the top two blocks next to eachother will be each player's hands. Below that will be a row of buttons where each player can decide whether or not to hit or stay. A message will appear at the top displaying who won the hand or if someone busted.
